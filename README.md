# Intro-to-nlp
- Most of the natural language processing was done using nltk.
- First the paragraph was tokenized into sentences and words.
- Then the paragraph was filtered by removing the stop words.
- Stemming was also done to change the tenses and conjugation.
- Then using PunktSentenceTokenizer I trained a custom tokenizer on the state of the union address of 2005.
- Then used the tokenizer to to tokenze the 2006 state of the unio address.
- Tagging was done using pos_tag.
- Then chunk was prepared using custom reg ex.
- Then chinking was done and subtee was generated.
- After that Named Entity recognition was performed.
- Finally Support Vector Machine was used to train and test text classification of movie reviews into negative and positive.
- Accuracy is : 0.792
